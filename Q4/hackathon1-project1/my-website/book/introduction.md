# Introduction to Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on building robotic systems! This book will take you through the fundamental concepts and practical implementations required to develop intelligent robots.

## About This Guide

This guide is designed to help you understand and implement robotic systems from the ground up. We begin with the foundational middleware that powers most modern robots - ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) - and gradually build up to more complex topics including AI agents, motion planning, and humanoid robotics.

## What You'll Learn

- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
  - Understanding ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
  - Bridging Python agents to ROS controllers
  - Working with URDF for robot description

- Advanced Topics (Coming Soon)
  - Motion planning algorithms
  - Perception systems
  - AI integration with robotic platforms
  - Humanoid robot control systems

## Getting Started

Before diving into the modules, ensure you have:
1. A working ROS 2 installation
2. Basic Python programming skills
3. Fundamental understanding of robotics concepts

Each module builds upon the previous one, so we recommend proceeding sequentially. The hands-on examples and exercises will help reinforce the theoretical concepts with practical implementations.

Let's begin this exciting journey into robotics!
