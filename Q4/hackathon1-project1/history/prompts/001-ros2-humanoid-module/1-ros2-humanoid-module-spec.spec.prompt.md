response_text: "Created comprehensive specification for ROS 2 fundamentals module for humanoid control systems. The specification includes three prioritized user stories covering ROS 2 basics, Python agent control, and URDF modeling. It defines 8 functional requirements, constitution-aligned requirements, key entities, and 6 measurable success criteria. A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification."
outcome: "Specification successfully created and validated for the ROS 2 fundamentals module. Ready for planning phase (/sp.plan)."
evaluation: "The specification meets all quality criteria with clear user scenarios, testable requirements, and measurable success outcomes. No clarifications needed."

# Prompt History Record

## Summary
Created comprehensive specification for ROS 2 fundamentals module for humanoid control systems.

## Details
- **Stage**: spec
- **Feature**: ros2-humanoid-module
- **Date**: 2025-12-09

## Content
The specification includes three prioritized user stories covering:
1. ROS 2 basics (nodes, topics, services, QoS)
2. Python agent control (rclpy, action servers, joint commands)
3. URDF modeling for humanoid robots

It defines 8 functional requirements, constitution-aligned requirements, key entities, and 6 measurable success criteria. A quality checklist was also created to validate the specification.
